# Old Wikipedia Style Safari Extension

This repository contains code for a basic Safari Extension to revert Wikipedia pages to their old style. This was done out of total frustration with the next Wikipedia layout. It is not perfect, but I am happy to dedicate time to improving it if there is external interest - feel free to create an issue or a PR.
